The exact list of what is heap-allocated or not is implementation-dependent. Some constant values can be heap-allocated but never deallocated during the lifetime of the program, for example a list of integer constants; this is also implementation-dependent. You should also be aware that compiler optimizations may duplicate some immutable values, for example floating-point numbers when stored into arrays; thus they can be finalized and collected while another copy is still in use by the program.</p><p>The results of calling <code>String</code>.make, <code>Bytes</code>.create, <code>Bytes</code>.make, <code>Array</code>.make, and <code>Pervasives</code>.ref are guaranteed to be heap-allocated and non-constant except when the length argument is <code>0</code>.</p></header><div class="content"></div></body></html>
