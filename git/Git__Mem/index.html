All of your repository is stored on your memory. For some specific purposes, it's useful. However, keep in your mind, when your program stops, you lost your repository obviously.</p><p>Because we don't need to handle any I/O operations, this store could be more fast than the Unix/Mirage store and relevant for testing. However, we still use the <code>Lwt</code> monad to protect mutable reference value against data-race condition.</p><p>Finally, this module respects the same API <code>Minimal</code>.S and can handle PACK file - and, by this way, can be used on the Smart protocol. Obviously, some ext. modules like <code>Index</code> could not be used with this store (because thay interact with a file-system back-end).</p></header><div class="content"></div></body></html>
