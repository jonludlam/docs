A job <code>f</code> is considered to be running from the time <code>f ()</code> is executed until the deferred returned by <code>f ()</code> becomes determined, or <code>f ()</code> raises. The throttle initiates jobs on a first-come first-served basis.</p><p>One can use <code>create_with</code> to create a throttle with &quot;resources&quot; that one would like to make available to concurrent jobs and to guarantee that different jobs access different resources.</p><p>A throttle is killed if one of its jobs throws an exception, and the throttle has <code>continue_on_error = false</code>. A throttle can also be explicitly <code>kill</code>ed. If a throttle is killed, then all jobs in it that haven't yet started are aborted, i.e., they will not start and will become determined with <code>`Aborted</code>. Jobs that had already started will continue, and return <code>`Ok</code> or <code>`Raised</code> as usual when they finish. Jobs enqueued into a killed throttle will be immediately aborted.</p></header><div class="content"></div></body></html>
